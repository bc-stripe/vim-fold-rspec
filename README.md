vim-rspec-folding
=================

This plugin provides automatic folding for RSpec files (`*_spec.rb`).

Conforms to RSpec DSL as of v3.6. Depends on strict, consistent, two-space indentation of context and example blocks, and supports Capybara keywords.

Installation
------------

There are lots of vim plugin managers out there. I like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
